summary: Cooking in the kitchen without supervision is certainly a recipe for disaster!
---

The door in one hand, it creaked

The other hand held a recipe—tweaked

As I strode into the kitchen

Cooking for myself a mission

<br />

Spoons and ladles flew

Into bowls and pans very few

The glasses and plates jingle

Adding music to the tingle

As batter, cream and flour

Lay splattered on the floor

<br />

I mashed in nuts and spices

Along with huge apple slices

Mixing it all with sugar and milk

Making it look like tiny crystals in silk

<br />

In the distance I heard a car horn hoot

I knew I had to find an escape route

Too late! For the moment mom appeared

The fun and frenzy—they disappeared

<br />

She said for being careless I had to pay

Utensils had stains that I scrubbed away

And the drain had to be unclogged

Right before the kitchen door was locked!

<br />

My days of being a chef were gone

Never was I to cook alone

And neither will I ever talk

Of my mastery with the wok
