summary: A young heart full of affection mourns the loss of a daisy-like love
---

On a dismal winter morning
With wisps of mist billowing
From my silence to your screams
A heartbreak blooms—and
I, the smoking gun without the fumes

Still, from afar I watched you
Burrow into sands that knew
Once tears of our love but
Now shattered crystals—a mess
Of erudite hopelessness

And bloom come spring you did
Like a resplendent flower so candid
Of tender petals and yellow heads
You radiate love far and wide
But I feel none of it but never cried

For as the world queued up to admire
I shrank away and silently retire
From your magnetic magnificence
To mourn, ruefully, my hazy
Doleful memories of a dainty daisy
