I crossed out one more square
On my Bingo grid that day
And when I thought the game unfair
You better grow up, they say

For now in triumphant victory I saw
Only others' humiliating defeat
While as a kid, I lost only to stare in awe
At my friends' winning feat

No longer did I spend the morn
Playing Monopoly and game
For growing up had me torn
Between family and late teen fame

Envious are those times when
I hoarded loveâ€”free and fair
But now bottled up and uneven
I struggle to receive my own share

Yet, staring at my crossed out calendar
Humming a melancholic tune
Letting my mind freely wander
I realised we grew up too soon
