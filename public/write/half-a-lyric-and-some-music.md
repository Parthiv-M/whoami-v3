From behind the library shelves

my books and I listened to you

play chords on the piano

like very few do.

You kept your songs a secret

from me all along,

but hearing your falsetto meant more

than the lyrics of the song.

<br />

We met every dayâ€”you at the piano

me behind the shelves,

a cocoon of solace

unbeknownst to ourselves.

<br />

We crawled out as humans

lost in the pursuit of love,

for in trying to be blithe butterflies

we were blind to the spluttering of the dove.

<br />

When the cocoon broke and you left,

in a fashion so heart wrenchingly poetic

that sometimes I still pine to hear

half a lyric and some music.
