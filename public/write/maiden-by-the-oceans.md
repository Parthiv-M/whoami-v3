summary: A solitary maiden bides time yearning for her sailor lost in the deep blue seas
---

Beneath the moonless night sky
Forlorn I stood, awake and in wait of
A gruff and tough sailor from lands beyond
Who held me dearest in his heart

Putting on a charming smile
Many a time has he rowed up to me
And twirling a strand of my hair whispered
"Will you be mine, young maiden by the oceans?"

"Together we shall conquer the seven seas and
Sail through raging tempests around the world
I'll make you my queen", the glint in his eyes said,
"Forever, and forever aye!"

Under the dull green glow of
The solitary streetlamp on the beach today
Alone I stood in the silent sands of the night
Thinking of my lovesick sailor beyond the bay
